![Modern React business website by Aaron Durant](src/images/brand-screenshot.png "A modern React website by Aaron Durant")

This modern website wasn't my first business-focused project, nor was it my first time starting from a fresh create-react-app setup, but "brand." did mark my first website designed using styled-components.

I welcomed an opportunity to strengthen my ability to work with React, and learning about styled-components was a significant bonus! As a result of creating this website, I have more confidence that I'll be able to make similar sites for actual production moving forward.
